## You will learn how to:

- Create a new React application using Next
- Configure `@kobbleio/next` SDK
- Protect your application routes
- Add permissions and quotas to your application

<Note>Pre-requisites: You need to [set up your Kobble account](/learning/quickstart/setup) before starting this guide.</Note>

## Example repository

To make your life simpler, we crafted various Next.js examples that you ca find in our [Next Examples Repository](https://github.com/kobble-io/kobble-next-examples).

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create your Next application">
        Scaffold your new Next application using [Next Create App](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation).

        ```bash
        npx create-next-app@latest
        ```

        Then, when prompted, choose the options you prefer for your project.

        We recommend the following setup:

        ```bash
        What is your project named? my-app
        Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
        Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
        Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
        Would you like to use `src/` directory? Yes
        Would you like to use App Router? Yes (mandatory)
        Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? Yes
        What import alias would you like configured? @/*
        ```

        <Warning>It's mandatory to use App Router to work with the @kobbleio/next SDK.</Warning>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install @kobbleio/next">
        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash npm
            npm install @kobbleio/next
            ```

            ```bash yarn
            yarn add @kobbleio/next
            ```

            ```bash pnpm
            pnpm add @kobbleio/next
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup the middleware">
        Our auth middleware allows you to protect your routes and handle the authentication flow seamlessly.

        Create a `middleware.ts` file in your project and add the following code:

        ```ts
        import { authMiddleware } from '@kobbleio/next/server'

        export default authMiddleware({
            publicRoutes: ['/'],
        });

        export const config = {
            matcher: [
            // exclude internal Next.js routes
            "/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)",
            // reinclude api routes
            "/(api|trpc)(.*)"
            ]
        };
        ```

        This middleware will automatically expose various routes to handle authentication.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup the Kobble Provider">
        To leverage kobble utilities inside client side components, you need to wrap your app with the `KobbleProvider` component.
        This is commonly done in the top level `layout.tsx` file.

        Here's how your `layout.tsx` file should look like:

        ```tsx
        import type { Metadata } from "next";
        import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
        import { KobbleProvider } from '@kobbleio/next/server';
        import "./globals.css";

        const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

        export const metadata: Metadata = {
            title: "Create Next App",
            description: "Generated by create next app",
        };

        export default function RootLayout({
            children,
        }: Readonly<{
            children: React.ReactNode;
        }>) {
            return (
                <html lang="en">
                    <body className={inter.className}>
                        <KobbleProvider>
                            {children}
                        </KobbleProvider>
                    </body>
                </html>
            );
        }
        ```
    Note that `KobbleProvider` itself is a server side component, and as such should not be rendered by a client component directly.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup the environment variables">
        At this stage, if you run the project, you will get the following errors:
        ```bash
        ⨯ Error: Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_KOBBLE_CLIENT_ID
        ```

        This is because we need to add our Kobble Client ID and Customer Portal Domain to the environment variables.

        <Note>If you don't know how to get these variables, it's covered in our [setup guide](/learning/quickstart/setup).</Note>


        Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and add the following environment variables.

        ```env
        KOBBLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
        NEXT_PUBLIC_KOBBLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_KOBBLE_DOMAIN=your-domain-url
        NEXT_PUBLIC_KOBBLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
        ```

        <Note>**KOBBLE_DOMAIN** and **KOBBLE_CLIENT_ID** can be found in [the Kobble Application we created earlier](/learning/quickstart/setup). The **REDIRECT_URI** could be any route of your choice since the domain points to your Next Application.</Note>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## User authentication

<Steps>
    <Step title="Handling user state (client side)">
        In your client side code you can directly use the `useAuth` hook and various built-in components to manage your user's state and permissions.

        Here's a simple example using `<SignedIn />`, `<SignedOut />`, `<LoginButton />`, `<LogoutButton />` components:

        ```tsx
        'use client'

        import {
            useAuth,
            SignedIn,
            SignedOut,
            LoginButton,
            LogoutButton,
        } from '@kobbleio/next/client'

        export default function Home() {
            const { user } = useAuth();

            return (
                <div>
                    <SignedIn>
                        <p>Welcome, {user?.name}</p>
                        <LogoutButton />
                    </SignedIn>

                    <SignedOut>
                        <p>Not authenticated</p>
                        <LoginButton />
                    </SignedOut>
                </div>
            )
        }
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Handling user state (server side)">
        On your server code you can leverage @kobbleio/next/server utilities to handle user state and permissions.

        ```ts
        import { getAuth } from '@kobbleio/next/server'

        export default async function handler(req, res) {
            const { session } = await getAuth();

            if (!session) {
                return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
            }

            // An active session was found. User and tokens can be accessed from the session object.
            <!-- YOUR LOGIC HERE -->
            console.log(session.user);
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions and quotas

<Steps>
    <Step title="Managing permissions (client side)">
        At this stage, you can manage your user's permissions and quotas client using our `<IsAllowed />` and `<IsForbidden />` components.

        <Note>To learn more about [permissions](https://docs.kobble.io/product/permissions) and [quotas](https://docs.kobble.io/product/quotas), check out the [Kobble documentation](https://docs.kobble.io/product/permissions).</Note>

        ```tsx
        import {
            IsAllowed,
            IsForbidden,
            SignedIn,
        } from '@kobbleio/next/client'

        export default function Home() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <SignedIn>
                        <IsAllowed permission="generate-image">
                            <button>Generate Image</button>
                        </IsAllowed>

                        <IsForbidden permission="generate-image">
                            <span>You're not allowed to generate images.</span>
                        </IsForbidden>
                    </SignedIn>
                </div>
            )
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Managing permissions (server side)">
        ```ts
        import { getKobble } from '@kobbleio/next/server'

        export default async function handler(req, res) {
            const { kobble } = await getKobble();

            const isAllowed = await kobble.acl.hasPermission('permission-name');

            <!-- YOUR LOGIC HERE -->
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Managing quotas (client side)">
        At this stage, you can manage your user's permissions and quotas client using our `<IsAllowed />` and `<IsForbidden />` components.

        <Note>To learn more about [permissions](https://docs.kobble.io/product/permissions) and [quotas](https://docs.kobble.io/product/quotas), check out the [Kobble documentation](https://docs.kobble.io/product/permissions).</Note>

        ```tsx
        import {
        IsAllowed,
        IsForbidden,
        SignedIn,
    } from '@kobbleio/next/client'

        export default function Home() {
        return (
            <div>
                <SignedIn>
                    <IsAllowed permission="generate-image">
                        <button>Generate Image</button>
                    </IsAllowed>

                    <IsForbidden quota="generated-images">
                        <span>You're not allowed to generate images.</span>
                    </IsForbidden>
                </SignedIn>
            </div>
        )
    }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Managing quotas (server side)">
        ```ts
        import { getKobble } from '@kobbleio/next/server'

        export default async function handler(req, res) {
            const { kobble } = await getKobble();

            const isAllowed = await kobble.acl.hasRemainingQuota('quota-name');

            <!-- YOUR LOGIC HERE -->
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
